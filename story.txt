The galaxy is at war. Warp Gates have revolutionized how battles are fought
across space, and humanity is thrown to the brink of savagery.  Two immortal
biologists, one from the revered Blue Empire,  and another from the infamous
Red Republic, decide that they are above this form of warfare. They form a
gentlemen.s agreement to look for an unconquered planet and decide which one
is the better scientist. They look across the neutral territories and find
on some remote planet called Eeyarth islands similar to the Galapagos
Islands.  These islands are filled with simple creatures, but they hold vast
evolutionary potential. The Biologists agree that the best way to decide who
is better is to hold a Battle of the Species! They each claim dominion of
half of the creatures on the planet, and try to raise the superior species.
Over generations, whoever raises the most deadly or resilient species will
claim victory. They must adapt and evolve. You must compete, and avoid
segfaults.
